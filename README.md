# Quantum Vault üîê

A next-generation time-locked savings protocol on Stacks blockchain featuring dynamic APY, social recovery, and automated yield optimization.

## üöÄ Overview

Quantum Vault revolutionizes DeFi savings by combining traditional time deposits with blockchain innovation. Users lock STX tokens for predetermined periods to earn competitive yields, with rates dynamically adjusted based on lock duration and deposit size. The protocol features guardian-based social recovery, ensuring funds are never permanently lost.

Daily Rewards = Annual Yield √∑ 365
```

- **Protocol Fee**: 2% on rewards
- **Early Withdrawal Penalty**: 10% of principal
- **Minimum Deposit**: 1 STX
- **Maximum Vaults**: 10 per user

### APY Tiers Breakdown
| Deposit Amount | Lock Duration | Base APY | Bonus APY | Total APY |
|---------------|---------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1-9 STX | Any | 5% | 0% | 5% |
| 10-49 STX | 7+ days | 5% | 2% | 7% |

## üîí Security Features

### Protection Mechanisms
1. **Time Locks**: Funds locked until maturity
2. **Guardian System**: Social recovery for lost keys
3. **Multi-signature**: 2-of-3 guardian consensus
4. **Emergency Mode**: Admin can pause operations
5. **Penalty System**: Discourages early withdrawals

### Guardian Recovery Process
```
1. Guardian initiates recovery
2. Other guardians vote (2 of 3 required)
3. Recovery executor transfers ownership
4. New owner gains vault access
```

### Best Practices
- Choose trusted guardians
- Diversify vault durations
- Enable auto-compound for long-term vaults
- Monitor APY multiplier changes
- Keep backup of vault IDs

## üîó Integration Examples

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Create vault with Stacks.js
const createVault = async (amount, days, autoCompound) => {
    const blocks = days * 144; // ~144 blocks per day
    const amountUstx = amount * 1000000; // Convert to microSTX
    
    const tx = await contract.createVault(
        amountUstx,
        blocks,
        autoCompound
    );
    
    return tx;
};
```

### Reward Monitoring
```javascript
// Monitor rewards in real-time
const monitorRewards = async (vaultId) => {
    const rewards = await contract.calculateCurrentRewards(vaultId);
    console.log(`Current rewards: ${rewards / 1000000} STX`);
    
    // Update every block
    setTimeout(() => monitorRewards(vaultId), 120000);
};
```

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What happens if I withdraw early?**
A: You'll receive your principal minus a 10% penalty. No rewards are paid for early withdrawals.

**Q: Can I add to an existing vault?**
A: No, but you can create multiple vaults (up to 10) with different parameters.

**Q: How does auto-compound work?**
A: When enabled, you can call `compound-rewards` to add accumulated rewards to your principal.

**Q: What if I lose access to my wallet?**
A: Your designated guardians can initiate recovery with 2-of-3 consensus.

**Q: Are rewards guaranteed?**
A: Rewards are calculated based on the APY at vault creation and the global multiplier.

**Q: Can I change my lock period?**
A: You can extend it for better rates, but cannot reduce it.
